# Character Placeholder Instructions

Since I can't directly create image files for you, here's how to create a simple placeholder character:

1. Open Preview app in macOS
2. Create a new blank image (File > New from Clipboard after copying a 200x200 blank area)
3. Use the drawing tools to draw a simple smiley face
4. Save the file as "helper_neutral.png" in your Desktop

Alternatively, you can:

1. Find any free-to-use cartoon character online
2. Download the image
3. Resize it to approximately 200x200 pixels
4. Save it as "helper_neutral.png"

Then, in Xcode:

1. Go to the Assets.xcassets folder
2. Find the helper_neutral.imageset
3. Drag and drop your character image into the "1x" placeholder
4. Build and run the app

If you have issues with the image, you can temporarily modify the CharacterView.swift file to use a standard SF Symbol instead:

```swift
// In CharacterView.swift, replace the Image view with:
if let image = currentFrame {
    Image(uiImage: image)
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        .frame(height: 200)
} else {
    // Use SF Symbol as fallback
    Image(systemName: "person.fill")
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        .frame(height: 150)
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
}
```

This will use a built-in SF Symbol as a placeholder until you add a proper character image.
