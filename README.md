## üöÄ AI/ML Technology Stack

### Machine Learning Models
- **User Preference Model**: Predicts your likelihood to prefer specific places
- **Place Recommendation Engine**: Ranks results based on personal behavior patterns
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Semantic understanding of queries and place descriptions
- **Intent Classification**: Automatically detects what you're looking for

### Natural Language Processing
- **Query Analysis**: Tokenization, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis
- **Semantic Search**: Understanding context beyond simple keyword matching
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Smart handling of queries with multiple meanings
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI confidence levels for better user experience

### Data Intelligence
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Learns from interaction duration, selections, and patterns
- **Temporal Preferences**: Understands time-based preferences (morning coffee, lunch spots)
- **Location Familiarity**: Recognizes and adapts to your familiar areas
- **Privacy-First Learning**: All learning happens on-device with anonymous data

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+
- OpenAI API Key (for enhanced AI responses)
- Google Places API Key (for comprehensive place data)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HelpingHand.git
cd HelpingHand
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Dependencies are automatically resolved via Swift Package Manager
open HelpingHand.xcodeproj
```

3. Configure API Keys:
```bash
# Copy the example secrets file
cp App/Config/secrets.json.example App/Config/secrets.json

# Edit with your API keys
# {
#   "openai_api_key": "your-openai-api-key-here",
#   "google_places_api_key": "your-google-places-api-key-here"
# }
```

4. Build and run:
- Select target device/simulator in Xcode
- Press `Cmd+R` to build and run
- The app works with fallback functionality even without API keys

- **Duplicate Detection**: Smart deduplication using Levenshtein distance
- **Quality Scoring**: ML-based relevance and quality assessment
- **Confidence Weighting**: Higher weight for well-established user preferences

### Key Features

#### Apple Store Search Intelligence
The app intelligently distinguishes between:
- **Apple Store searches**: "Apple Store near me", "buy iPhone", "Apple support"
- **Grocery searches**: "fresh apples", "organic apples", "grocery store apples"
- **Ambiguous searches**: "find apples" ‚Üí searches both Apple Stores and grocery stores

#### Emergency Services
- 911 Emergency Services
- Poison Control Center
- Mental Health Crisis Hotline
- National Suicide Prevention
- Domestic Violence Hotline
- Child Abuse Hotline
- Animal Poison Control

## üîß Configuration

### API Keys
The app supports multiple configuration methods:

1. **Environment Variables**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **Local Config File**: `App/Config/secrets.json` (gitignored)
3. **Fallback Mode**: Works without API key using predefined responses

### Location Services
- Requires location permission for optimal experience
- Falls back to Dallas, TX area when location unavailable
- Supports both real-time GPS and fallback locations

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for the Apple Store search intelligence:
