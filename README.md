## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.0+
- macOS for development

## Quick Start

### Option 1: VS Code Tasks (Recommended)
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Select "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Choose **"Build and Run in Simulator"**

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
# Build for simulator
xcodebuild -project HelpingHand.xcodeproj -scheme HelpingHand -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.3.1' build
```

## Installation

1. ✅ Repository is ready (no additional setup needed)
2. ✅ Open `HelpingHand.xcodeproj` in Xcode or VS Code
3. ✅ Project builds successfully out of the box
3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a new scheme or edit the existing one
   - Add the following environment variable:
     - OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key

## Configuration

The app requires an OpenAI API key for the AI features. Set it up as an environment variable:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

For security reasons, never commit your API keys to the repository.

## Technical Configuration

### Current Build Settings ✅
- **Bundle ID**: `com.helpinghand.app.local`
- **Target Platform**: iOS Simulator (iPhone 16)
- **Code Signing**: Manual (simulator-only, no developer account required)
- **Swift Version**: 5.0
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 15.0+

### Dependencies
- **OpenAI SDK**: 0.4.3 (AI chat functionality)
- **OpenCombine**: 0.14.0 (reactive programming)
- **SwiftUI & UIKit**: Native iOS UI frameworks
- **CoreLocation**: GPS and location services
- **MapKit**: Map integration

## Environment Setup

### OpenAI API Key (Optional)
To enable AI chat functionality:
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Update `App/Source/Configuration/APIConfig.swift`:
   ```swift
   static let openAIAPIKey = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

## Available VS Code Tasks

- **"Build HelpingHand for Simulator"** - Build only
- **"Build and Run in Simulator"** - Build + install + launch
- **"Clean Build Folder"** - Clean build artifacts

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- **Clean build**: Use "Clean Build Folder" task or `xcodebuild clean`
- **Dependencies**: Restart Xcode if package resolution fails
- **Simulator**: Ensure iPhone 16 simulator is available

### Runtime Issues
- **Location permissions**: Grant when prompted in simulator
- **OpenAI chat**: Requires valid API key in `APIConfig.swift`
- **Network connectivity**: Ensure internet connection for AI features
