# Deployment Guide

This guide covers how to prepare the Helping Hand app for deployment to GitHub and production use.

## Pre-deployment Checklist

1. **Clean Build**
   - Run a clean build in Xcode
   - Fix any warnings or issues
   - Clean Build Folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)

2. **Test Mode**
   - App runs in test mode by default using mock data
   - No real API keys or location services required
   - Test mode can be disabled in production by updating `isTestMode` in configuration

3. **Security**
   - No sensitive data in source control
   - Test results stored in `test-results/` directory (git-ignored)
   - Quality reports stored in `quality-reports/` directory (git-ignored)
   - Local user data stored securely in app sandbox

4. **Assets**
   - Character images optional with SF Symbols fallback
   - All included assets are properly licensed
   - Asset catalog optimized for different devices

## GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **.gitignore**
   - Proper Xcode specific ignores
   - No user-specific files included
   - Test results and reports excluded
   - Environment files excluded

3. **Required Files**
   - README.md with setup instructions
   - LICENSE (MIT)
   - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (this file)
   - TESTING_GUIDE.md with testing instructions

## Production Configuration

1. **Location Services**
   - Uses CoreLocation and MapKit
   - No API keys required
   - Proper permission handling implemented

2. **Data Storage**
   - Local storage only
   - No remote sync implemented yet
   - User data stored securely in app sandbox

## Future Considerations

1. **API Integration**
   - When adding real AI services, use environment variables
   - Document API setup in README
   - Never commit API keys to source control

2. **Analytics**
   - If adding analytics, use environment variables
   - Document setup process
   - Respect user privacy
